I am **Love Sundin**, a computational biology master's student at Lund University.

# Education

I have a bachelor's degree in molecular biology from Lund University. I also studied mathematics and computer science during the bachelor's program. My bachelor's thesis was on the ALT mechanism for telomere elongation in yeast cells, and I did in Marita Cohn's lab. Recently, I started the master's program in applied computational science, biology, and I am currently taking courses in bioinformatics.
